Investigation of Structure and Dynamics of Glyme Based Electrolytes for Sodium Rechargeable Batteries 	Poster Presentation	talk-1	255th ACS National Meeting Exposition	2018-03	New Orleans, LA, USA		The cost of lithiated materials can potentially become a barrier for the large scale use of lithium based rechargeable battery technologies. The natural abundance of sodium and its chemical similarity to lithium makes it a favorable candidate to replace lithium in both metal ion and metal air battery technologies.    An important aspect of designing such energy storage devices is optimizing the electrolyte component. Given the stability of ether based electrolytes compared to traditional organic carbonates, especially in a metal-air system, they are an excellent starting point for developing suitable electrolytes. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the solvation and charge transport dynamics of glyme based electrolytes with the sodium triflate salt. The purpose of this work is two-fold, namely to understand the effect of glyme chain length and salt concentration on dynamics and structure as well as to validate our force-field using experimental data from FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The results from our simulation on ion-association as well as comparison of the diffusion of different constituents will be presented and discussed.
Computational Study of Structure and Dynamics of Glyme Based Electrolytes for Sodium Rechargeable Batteries  Oral Presentation	talk-2 257th ACS National Meeting Exposition	2019-03-01	Orlando, FL, USA	    Ether-based electrolytes have become promising candidates for sodium rechargeable batteries due to their chemical stability. The salt concentration of the electrolytes has a huge impact on the battery performance, because the viscosity of the electrolyte will increase as well as ion-pairing effects with the increased salt concentration. However, the ion-pairing can change the reaction products and hence affect battery performance. Experiments have also shown that the conductivities of these electrolytes increase as a function of concentration. To fully understand these electrolytes at a molecular level, the solvation and charge transport dynamics of glyme based electrolytes with the sodium triflate salt at different concentrations were investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. Two different mechanisms were found through our simulations for the charge transport, namely a traditional vehicular mechanism based on the free ion diffusion and a hopping mechanism involving the triflate anion.
