Dr. Zhicheng Jin is a nanomaterial chemist. He received his bachelorâ€™s degree in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering from Lanzhou University in 2015, Gansu, China. His undergraduate research projects were conducted under Dr. Zhengping Dong, and were about using IONPs and Palladium hetero-nanoparticles for catalysis. During his undergraduate time, Zhicheng received several scholarships that supported him to study abroad at Texas Tech University (USA) and Manitoba University (Canada). 


He then pursued his graduate study at the Florida State University, Tallahassee, USA, earning both MSc and PhD degrees in Materials Science in 2020 under the supervision of Dr. Hedi Mattoussi. During his doctoral research he worked on designing functional nanomaterials and realizing the applications (*e.g.*, pH sensing & FRET probe) in biology.


He is currently working as a Postdoctoral Fellow with Dr. Jesse Jokerst at UC San Diego (USA). His research interest still focuses on developing the technology of chemically synthesized inorganic nanocrystals for biological detection (*e.g.*, COVID-19 detection). This includes challenges in making new compositions of nanocrystals and multifunctional surface ligands including PEG and synthetic biomolecules, with the ultimate goal of incorporating the hybrid nanocomposites into biological systems and/or optoelectronic devices.

He likes trailing, hiking, playing guitar, and making many friends. Zhicheng is actively looking for a faculty position in China as his career goal.
