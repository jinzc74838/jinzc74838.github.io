The cost of lithiated materials can potentially become a barrier for the large scale use of lithium based rechargeable battery technologies. The natural abundance of sodium and its chemical similarity to lithium makes it a favorable candidate to replace lithium in both metal ion and metal air battery technologies. An important aspect of designing such energy storage devices is optimizing the electrolyte component. Given the stability of ether based electrolytes compared to traditional organic carbonates, especially in a metal-air system, they are an excellent starting point for developing suitable electrolytes. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we explore the solvation and charge transport dynamics of glyme based electrolytes with the sodium triflate salt. The purpose of this work is two-fold, namely to understand the effect of glyme chain length and salt concentration on dynamics and structure as well as to validate our force-field using experimental data from FTIR and NMR spectroscopy. The results from our simulation on ion-association as well as comparison of the diffusion of different constituents will be presented and discussed.
